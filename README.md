<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>To rate Swisschems Noopept, I followed a simple yet rigorous protocol:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity checks:</strong> Verified third‑party lab results for heavy metals and potency.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage trials:</strong> Started at 10 mg sublingual, gradually increased to 25 mg over two weeks.</li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive tests:</strong> Used memory apps, reaction‑time tools, and attention span exercises.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily logs:</strong> Recorded mood, clarity, mental processing speed, and any side effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Benchmarked against other suppliers’ Noopept and phenylpiracetam powders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these factors, I scored it 4.7 / 5 for potency, ease of use, and overall mental boost.</p>

<h2>Personal Experience</h2>
<p>After my first dose of 15 mg, I noticed sharper working memory and better focus within 30 minutes. During study sessions, I could recall facts faster and felt less distracted. By day seven, reaction‑time tests improved by about 12%. On tougher workdays, mental fatigue dropped noticeably.</p>
<p>I also stacked Noopept with 300 mg alpha‑GPC to support acetylcholine levels and avoid any mild headaches. That combination gave me smooth, sustained attention for up to 6 hours, perfect for writing, coding, or strategic gaming.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
